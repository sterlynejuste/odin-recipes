        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is one of my <em>favorite</em> dishes. It's expensive to make, so my mom usually saves it for special occassions, my birthday being one of them. I should learn to make to it myself but Haitian cooking takes too long! We shall see...</p>
        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3.5 lbs pork feet steaks about 8 pieces – cleaned with vinegar</li>
            <li>½ cup sour orange juice</li>
            <li>1/3 cup lemon juice or lime juice</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons garlic Chopped</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>6 cloves</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon black pepper ground</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups hot water more if needed</li>
            <li>1 bouquet garni thyme and parsley</li>
            <li>1 cup carrots sliced</li>
            <li>½ cup sweet peppers or green peppers</li>
            <li>1 cup onions sliced</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>Noubess Hot Sauce to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Clean meat with vinegar and rinse with water. Pat dry and set aside. In a small bowl, mix orange juice, lemon/lime juice, garlic, salt, pepper, and cloves. Add marinade to meat. Mix well and let marinate for at least 2 – 3 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>In a heavy pot or dutch oven, add oil and tomato paste. Let fry for about 3 – 4 minutes. Add meat and marinade. Let meat cook until the marinade has almost evaporated. Add hot water or boiling water, 1 cup intervals until meat is fully cooked. This may take about 45 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>On low heat, in a saucepan, add 1 cup of marinate/meat water. Add carrots, sweet peppers and onions. Cook veggies halfway. Add meat and bring to a boil. Season with salt, pepper, Noubess Hot Sauce and let meat and veggies cook for about 8 to 10 minutes until the sauce has thickens. Serve hot with your preferred side dish.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Cacio e Pepe is one of my favorite dishes that I remember when traveling in Rome. It's so simple; the name literally translates to cheese and pepper. You might think this dish wouldn't have much flavor... you'd be pleasantly surprised.</p>
        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>6 oz. pasta (such as egg tagliolini, bucatini, or spaghetti)</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cubed, divided</li>
            <li>1 tsp. freshly cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>¾ cup finely grated Grana Padano or Parmesan</li>
            <li>⅓ cup finely grated Pecorino</li>
            <li>6 oz. pasta (such as egg tagliolini, bucatini, or spaghetti)</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cubed, divided</li>
            <li>1 tsp. freshly cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>¾ cup finely grated Grana Padano or Parmesan</li>
            <li>⅓ cup finely grated Pecorino</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring 3 quarts water to a boil in a 5-qt. pot. Season with salt; add pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until about 2 minutes before tender. Drain, reserving ¾ cup pasta cooking water.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt 2 Tbsp. butter in a Dutch oven or other large pot or skillet over medium heat. Add pepper and cook, swirling pan, until toasted, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add ½ cup reserved pasta water to skillet and bring to a simmer. Add pasta and remaining butter. Reduce heat to low and add Grana Padano, stirring and tossing with tongs until melted. Remove pan from heat; add Pecorino, stirring and tossing until cheese melts, sauce coats the pasta, and pasta is al dente. (Add more pasta water if sauce seems dry.) Transfer pasta to warm bowls and serve.</li>
        </ol>

        <img src="https://www.daringgourmet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Schnitzel-5.jpg" alt="a plate of the German dish called Schnitzel">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Schnitzel is such a yummy comfort food. I can still see me and my friend sitting in the Brauhaus in Bavaria and loving German beer despite hating any American one I've tried before it, <em>haha</em>!</p>
        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 boneless pork steaks or chops, (to make Austrian Wienerschnitzel use thin veal cutlets)</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour combined with 1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>3/4 cup plain breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>Oil for frying (use a neutral-tasting oil with a high smoke point)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the pork chops between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound them until just 1/4 inch thick with the flat side of a meat tenderizer. Lightly season both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Place the flour mixture, egg, and breadcrumbs in 3 separate shallow bowls. Dip the chops in the flour, the egg, and the breadcrumbs, coating both sides and all edges at each stage. Be careful not to press the breadcrumbs into the meat. Gently shake off the excess crumbs. Don't let the schnitzel sit in the coating or they will not be as crispy once fried - fry immediately.</li>
            <li>Make sure the cooking oil is hot enough at this point (about 330 degrees F) as you don't want the Schnitzel to sit around in the coating before frying. Use enough oil so that the Schnitzels "swim" in it. Fry the Schnitzel for about 2-3 minutes on both sides until a deep golden brown. Transfer briefly to a plate lined with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with slices of fresh lemon and parsley sprigs or with your choice of sauce. Serve with German Spaetzle (see recipe for Homemade German Spaetzle), French fries, or German potato salad, and with a fresh leafy green salad.</li>
